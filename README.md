# DM Mono

DM Mono is a 3 weight, 3 style family designed for DeepMind.
DM Mono was loosely based off of DM Sans, with a reduction in contrast and less geometric proportions.

The type design and font development was commissioned from [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org), with Creative Direction from the DeepMind team.
